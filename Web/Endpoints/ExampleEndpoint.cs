    // INTERVIEW NOTES: Ran out of time to build out an example for this

    //  Short summary:
    //  In the past I've referenced something like the Domain project for the message interfaces,
    //  and used MassTransit to send out the messages to the Service layer via ASB/RabbitMQ.
    //  However, that doesn't follow the Clean Code design outline fully,
    //  so it would depend on what level of seperation is desired here.
    //  A MediatR handler layer could be added to correct that,
    //  but I've always felt that was an unecissary level of abstraction.
